            <p><strong>ALT School ID:</strong> ALT SOE/024/0370</p>
            <p>Hello! I'm Izibevie Gift, a passionate learner with a background in microbiology. I joined ALT School because I am eager to gain knowledge and skills in engineering to solve real-world problems and build impactful projects. The School of Engineering program aligns perfectly with my career goals, which include becoming a proficient software engineer and contributing to innovative technology solutions.
                <br><br>
                Outside of tech, I love reading books and catching the latest movies.
                I started following Alt School Africa last year on Instagram and kept looking forward to applying.
                I joined Alt School because of its personalized learning, innovation in education, and its project-based learning.
            </p>
            <p>My primary goals for joining the School of Engineering include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Gaining hands-on experience with modern engineering tools and techniques.</li>
                <li>Developing strong problem-solving skills through real-world projects.</li>
                <li>Networking with industry professionals and fellow students.</li>
                <li>To build and participate in open source projects.</li>
